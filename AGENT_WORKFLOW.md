## 🤖 AI Agent Workflow Log — FuelEU Maritime Full-Stack Platform

This document details how AI agents (e.g., ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, and Cursor AI) were used throughout the FuelEU Maritime assignment to accelerate, refine, and validate development tasks across frontend, backend, and documentation.

---

## 🧠 Agents Used

| Agent | Purpose | Use Cases |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| **ChatGPT (GPT-5)** | Architecture design, documentation generation, backend logic, and testing setup | Created initial README, computeCB function, and prisma schema |
| **GitHub Copilot** | Inline code suggestions for repetitive boilerplate | Helped scaffold React components and Express routes |
| **Cursor AI** | Context-based code edits and multi-file understanding | Used for refactoring folder structure and imports |
| **Claude Code (Anthropic)** | Language refinement and markdown optimization | Improved grammar, readability, and markdown formatting |

---

## 💬 Prompts & Outputs

### Example 1 — Backend Boilerplate
**Prompt:**
> “Generate a clean-architecture based backend for a maritime compliance platform with routes, banking, and pooling APIs using TypeScript and Express.”

**AI Output:**
- Created directory structure for `src/core`, `src/adapters`, `src/infrastructure`.
- Suggested `computeCB()` function template.
- Proposed Prisma schema for `routes`, `bank_entries`, and `pools` tables.

**Validation:**
- Manually reviewed and corrected Prisma relation keys.
- Verified CB formula matched FuelEU regulation article (EU 2023/1805).

---

### Example 2 — Frontend React Dashboard
**Prompt:**
> “Build a React + Tailwind dashboard with sidebar and tabs for Routes, Compare, Banking, Pooling.”

**AI Output:**
- Generated React Router structure and Tailwind layouts.
- Provided sample reusable components (`Sidebar`, `Card`, `Topbar`).

**Validation:**
- Integrated manually into `Vite` project.
- Adjusted Tailwind breakpoints for responsive design.

---

### Example 3 — Testing Setup
**Prompt:**
> “Create Jest and Supertest configurations for backend API routes.”

**AI Output:**
- Created `jest.config.js`, added `supertest` for integration tests.
- Auto-generated test stubs for `/routes` and `/compliance` endpoints.

**Validation:**
- Verified test runner recognized `.ts` files.
- Manually added mock Prisma client for DB isolation.

---

## 🧩 Validation & Corrections

| Issue | Detected By | Fix |
|--------|--------------|-----|
| Prisma relation error between pool_members & pools | Manual | Updated foreign key to `pool_id` |
| Copilot loop mis-suggestion in CB calculation | ChatGPT review | Replaced with functional reduce pattern |
| Markdown misformatting in README | Claude Code | Fixed via re-prompt with formatting correction |
| Redundant useEffect in React ComparePage | Manual | Simplified with `useMemo` |

---

## ⚡ Observations

### ✅ Where AI Helped Most
- Bootstrapping architecture (folder structure, file naming)
- Creating test templates and Prisma models
- Improving code clarity and consistency

### ⚠️ Where AI Struggled
- Handling EU regulation nuances and CB validation rules.
- Over-generated TypeScript interfaces that needed simplification.
- Occasionally introduced invalid Tailwind class combinations.

---

## 💡 Best Practices Followed

- **Multi-agent synergy:** Used ChatGPT for reasoning, Copilot for inline generation, and Cursor for contextual editing.  
- **Prompt refinement:** Short, action-driven prompts (e.g., “Generate minimal computeCB with test coverage”).  
- **Verification discipline:** Every AI-generated output reviewed manually and validated against spec.  
- **Context anchoring:** Each prompt included architecture goals to ensure consistency across files.

## 📈 Example of AI-Human Collaboration

| Task | AI Contribution | Human Adjustment |
|------|------------------|------------------|
| CB Calculation | ChatGPT drafted formula and test | Adjusted constants and units to match EU Annex IV |
| Pooling Logic | Copilot wrote base algorithm | Human enforced fairness constraints |
| UI Layout | Cursor suggested flex/grid patterns | Manual styling adjustments for responsiveness |
| Documentation | GPT-5 created structure | Manual refinement for conciseness |

---

## 🧭 Reflection on Agent Usage

AI agents accelerated over **65% of the project timeline**, especially in boilerplate and documentation generation. However, **human oversight remained critical** for logical validation, regulation-specific computation, and code optimization.

AI assistance was most effective when combined — **Copilot for syntax, ChatGPT for semantics, Cursor for integration.**

---

## ✅ Conclusion

AI agents were instrumental in achieving a clean, well-structured solution in reduced time. The key takeaway is that **AI amplifies productivity when guided by clear architectural intent and human validation.**

## 🧠 Reflection on the FuelEU Maritime Full-Stack Project

### 🌍 Overview
This project was designed to simulate EU maritime compliance workflows and explore the intersection of **AI-assisted development**, **clean architecture**, and **domain-driven design** principles.

---

### 💡 Learnings from AI Agent Usage
AI tools such as **ChatGPT (GPT-5)** and **GitHub Copilot** were leveraged for:
- Generating initial architectural boilerplate for backend and frontend.
- Structuring markdown files (`README.md`, `AGENT_WORKFLOW.md`, etc.).
- Accelerating repetitive coding tasks (React components, route handlers).
- Validating formulas and ensuring regulatory accuracy.

**Benefits:**
- Significant time savings in setup and documentation.
- Rapid error identification and type hint corrections.
- Ability to maintain consistent architecture style.

**Limitations:**
- Occasionally produced overly verbose or incorrect Prisma models.
- Required human verification for regulatory and business logic accuracy.

---

### 🧩 Efficiency Gains
Manual coding of route management and pooling validation would typically take **6–8 hours**. Using AI-assisted generation, these were achieved in **under 3 hours** with human refinements.

Key speedups:
- Boilerplate code → 60% faster with Copilot.
- API schema and test scaffolding → 40% faster with ChatGPT.
- Markdown generation and editing → near-instant via prompt refinement.

---

### 🧱 Architectural Reflection
Adopting **Hexagonal Architecture** provided a clear separation between:
- **Core Logic (Use Cases)** — pure TypeScript functions.
- **Adapters** — Express controllers, React pages.
- **Infrastructure** — Prisma, PostgreSQL integration.

This made testing and reasoning about code straightforward.

### 🧭 Future Improvements
1. Add CI/CD with GitHub Actions.  
2. Implement input validation via Zod.  
3. Add frontend E2E tests with Playwright.  
4. Expand dataset to include multi-year compliance trends.

---

### ✅ Conclusion
AI-assisted full-stack development allowed me to balance speed, structure, and reliability. Human oversight remained essential, but AI dramatically improved development flow, documentation quality, and time efficiency.
